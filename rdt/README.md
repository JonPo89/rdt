# rdt. 
A minimal reddit website.

## Description

This is a project that I took on to practise and showcase some skills in Redux and React.  It accesses the .json components off Reddit, allowing users to scroll through posts, and comments in some of the more popular subreddits.

## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues.
